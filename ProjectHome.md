Twit-Graph visualizes twitter search results.
If you'd like to measure what twitter users thing about you, enter a search term, e.g. youtube, and you'll be able to see on a graph how many tweets are posted every day.
The project uses Google's appengine platform and is hosted at http://twitgraph.appspot.com
